Note:

Additional Features
- Added `visibility` attribute to the Topic model for public & private topics (similar to  the [blog project](https://github.com/Shreehar-KE/pcc-django-blog))
- Removed help text in the __Registration__ page.
- Restriction of __register__, __login__ & __logout__ pages as per the user's authentication.
  - This is to prevent a scenario like: Logged-in user trying the access the __register__ or __login__ url.
  - This is implemented using custom middleware in the `accounts` app.
- New `edit-topic` feature to edit a blog's title & visibility.
- Conditional Display of `create-entry`, `edit-entry` & `edit-topic` links in __topic__ page based on the user's authentication.
